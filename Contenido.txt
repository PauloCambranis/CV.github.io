Nucleotide data pipeline
Thesis project
z September 2022 – Ongoing
I developed a pipeline using the Biopython library to extract
DNA sequence entries from NCBI’s Nucleotide database. This
successfully parsed and organized data to create a comprehensive 
database of parasitic fungus species reports, categorized by
country and host of origin.

The objective was to improve the efficiency of future research by
creating more specific PCR primers.

Academic Highlights

Scientific poster
Confiq 2021
After suggesting modifications to a course’s final project, I was
able to present the results in a symposium organized by the uni-
versity. The poster was titled (translated from Spanish) "Fermen-
tation kynetics of a mexican traditional beverage as a learning
model for online courses using readily available materials" and is
available (in Spanish) at https://youtu.be/qbo7UNW8fK0

Microbiology and food safety experiment design
Microbiology lab, FIQ, UADY
2021 - Ongoing
As a Kombucha brewer, I teamed up with two professors to de-
sign a practical project for junior students at my faculty. We de-
signed the parameters and the protocol the students would follow
in order to gain insight of kombucha fermentation under tropical
conditions. I also supported the teachers by giving talks about fer-
mented beverages and kombucha, as well as giving advice to my
fellow students during the experiments
